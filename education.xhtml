                    I had a study gap for 1 year because of some family issues. I started
                    my Bachelors studies in 2016 at <font color="red">"American Internation University of
                    Bangladesh"</font> in <font color="purple">"Computer Science and Engineering" </font>.I love my University.
                    The campus is really beautiful, neat and clean. By the Grace of God, I 
                    will hopefully finish my Bachelors studies within 2020 and then I plan on going 
                    abroad for my Masters.</font></pre></h2> </td>
